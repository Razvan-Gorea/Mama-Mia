# Pizza Web Application

This is a cool project I created using the python django web framework. It is a pizza ordering system. The user can create their own custom pizza and at the end view their order. Pico CSS was used for styling the application. 

To get started do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the root of your cloned repository
3. Run `python3 manage.py runserver`

Enjoy creating your own pizza!
